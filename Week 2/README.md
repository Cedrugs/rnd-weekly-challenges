# Week 2 - React Flash Cards

A React-based flashcard application designed as part of a Week 2 project. This application aims to enhance learning using flashcards to test user knowledge on React concepts from beginner to advanced levels.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to apply fundamental React concepts such as components, props, state, re-rendering, and event handling to create an interactive learning tool. Users can view questions on flashcards, flip them to reveal answers, and assess their understanding of React.

## Key Features

- **Home Page:** 
  - Displays the title, subtitle, logo, and badge at the top of the website as per the design specifications.

- **Flash Cards Display:** 
  - Shows a list of flashcards with questions when the user visits the page. Each card includes the question text and difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard).

- **Answer Reveal:** 
  - Allows users to flip a flashcard to see the answer. Clicking on a card changes its display to show the answer, and clicking again or switching to another card resets the view.

## Technologies Used

- **React** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite** - A build tool that provides a fast development environment for modern web projects.
